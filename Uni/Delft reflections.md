Scenario no. 1
Plagiarism is out of the question, not only it is morally dubious but it is also indefensible as a means out of the situation for I would not be able to fully comprehend a work that is not my own. This approach would not work because as far as I am concerned, assignments are give out to incite us to research and understand a topic. As such I do not believe that copying the content or sources from my roommate is a viable option. The use of ChatGPT is very lucrative, however from my past practices I recognize it as a tool, I may use it to gather information quickly or verify statements, however I also recognize its shortcomings. My general moto is that ChatGPT is a source like any other, if used it must be accompanied by a disclaimer and credited. In a situation where I have very little time to polish my work and get a low grade as a result, I cannot help but feel like that is the price to pay for the delay, even if it was hard to foresee.  Overall, my course of action is rather simple, I must complete the assignment and that is what I shall do, I will use ChatGPT in accordance with academic integrity guidelines and will have to live with the lower grade but avoid the threat of punishment for plagiarism.

1. Aerospace Engineering & Design - generally that is my favorite part of engineering, I have a lot of experience with CAD and general sketching from my hobbies and experience in CanSat. I believe I feel so strongly about it because I get the chance to let my imagination take over, I enjoy general meandering until I think of a design that works, however I also strive to hone that skill so the meandering takes less and my designs become more efficient. I hope that with additional mentoring I will be able to create such designs and actually consider myself competent in that regard. However, most of all I hope that the skills gained will help me to apply it in practice and be knowledgeable enough to perhaps help and tutor others.
2. Calculus II - Mathematics generally is a hard field for me, I often struggle to maintain the necessary mathematical rigor to follow from one theorem to another. It becomes highly pronounced in calculus, where a magnitude of concepts intertwine. Nevertheless, I find calculus inherently interesting, which serves as a strong motivator to carry on through such challenges. I know that perseverance will be the most important factor and I have in the past, with the intention of continuing to do so, spend extra time to try and reach the breaking point. My ultimate goal is to understand the subject, despite the challenges involved and strengthen my problem-solving skills along with improving my ability to connect different mathematical ideas.

1. I am particularly excited about the syllabus topics as they offer the invaluable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge directly in practice which helps to deepen the contemporary understanding. I believe it so because the ability to see the idea materialize is extremely motivating to me and thus I anticipate to perform the best in areas regarding design and production. Such subjects make me feel deeply engaged, making it much easier to maintain my drive and push forwards until I achieve my goals. However, I recognize that purely theoretical subjects might pose additional challenge as the lack of additional engagement might impact my performance. That said, being aware of this potential obstacle allows me to act proactively in response. By trying to maintain a balanced approach towards all subjects, I am confident I can overcome any motivational gaps and perform well in both applied and theoretical disciplines. Ultimately, I believe that with the right mindset and dedication I can math, if not exceed, my performance in applied sciences, which emboldens me to push forwards.
2. While according to basic interpretation of the score I did have sufficient knowledge, I feel underwhelmed by my performance. One of the main obstacles were the tasks regarding vectors, however that is because we haven't gone over that topic at school, hence I had to rely on my own knowledge. The second most challenging topic, though to a much lesser extent, were basic electronic exercises, I pride myself on my electronics knowledge, but I could not solve the tasks quickly enough due to the algebra involved.  In the future, I shall spend extra time on linear algebra, after all that is the topic where I have the least knowledge. I believe that by the time of the admission exam I will have sufficient knowledge to reach higher scores.
3. I feel like I do possess the skills to carry me through the first year, I have great experience in design and electronics, I feel great working in a team and helping to manage projects. I can manage my time to feel comfortable with the amount of assignments and projects. Naturally, I compare my expectations for university to my experiences in the IB program. Given the rigorous nature of IB, I anticipate similarities in workload and difficulty, and having already learned—albeit through great effort—how to manage such an environment, I feel prepared to take on the challenges at TU Delft. However, I do not want to fall into the illusion that I am completely ready. As an extension to that, I believe that any skill gap that I may discover could be filled with appropriate dedication and preparation. Generally, I do not fear for my knowledge of physics or mathematics, despite being challenging I know of techniques that help me study and manage my time. Furthermore, with my skills in team and project management, I believe I can firmly navigate through the program's projects. Lastly, I strive to keep a balance between studying and socializing as it helps to maintain my general psychological wellbeing as that plays a large part in my performance.
4. I very much still do want to enroll. I paid particular attention to the students' descriptions of the life on campus, I felt excited after seeing brief shots of the wind tunnel and generally felt very pleased by their descriptions. However, more importantly than that, I feel passionate about aerospace engineering in TU Delft because it is an opportunity to gain skills from one of the most prestigious institutions in Europe, I recognize that it may be my best chance at gaining and honing both new and current skills. With the coupled ability to adapt my knowledge in practice. Most notably, I realize that the path onward will be hard, I may not excel in the core fields, however my personal philosophy has long been to pursue ambitious goals "not because they are easy, but because they are hard." With this mindset, I am ready to commit myself fully to the rigorous and demanding path that lies ahead, knowing that it will push me to grow both academically and personally.
